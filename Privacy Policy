We may collect:

Device information (such as headset type, operating system, crash logs, performance data).

Non-personal usage data (such as actions within the virtual environment, preferences for viewing furniture, and interactions with objects).

Optional user inputs (if you choose to save or customize layouts, these are stored locally on your device unless you explicitly share them).

We use collected information to:

Provide and improve app functionality.

Ensure stability, security, and performance.

Analyze anonymized usage trends to enhance the user experience.

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for advertising purposes.

Data is primarily stored locally on your device.

Any analytics or crash reports shared with us are anonymized and used only to improve performance.

We apply reasonable security measures to protect your data.

4. Third-Party Services

The application does not include third-party advertisements and does not use third-party tracking for targeted advertising, in compliance with Meta Store policies.

If third-party services are integrated in the future (e.g., analytics or cloud storage), they will comply with applicable data protection regulations and be clearly disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Our application is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
